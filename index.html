      <h1>Blonde Girl isn't Real</h1>
      <hr />
      <h2>An Exposé</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">A</span>s we all know, there has been a
          recent newfound obsession with fictional characters collectively
          called "blonde girl." This mishmash of a terrible idea is kidnapping
          the psyche of our youth. This <em>blonde girl</em> must be stopped.
          She is a manifestation of the schizophrenic underbelly that the
          pressures of the soul place upon our brilliant children. We must do
          everything possible to neutraulize and <u>contain</u> this expression
          of outright aggression towards us: our people and our fluids. The
          blonde girl phenomena is indicitive of the inevitable Fourth Turning
          that ancestors predated have approximated. A dissent against the
          status quo, non-conformist <b>fanatical</b> blonde girl disciples will
          surrender to the air and fly. Cracking and splitting our great scheme
          which theories have prevailed.
          <del>We must strike her down.</del> KILL HER. Protect our fluids. We
          <b>CANNOT</b> allow blonde girl infiltration. It is our function to
          assure our A-1, superlative fluids.
        </p>
        <div class="list">
          <ol>
            <li>bad</li>
            <li>bad</li>
            <li>terrible</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>Innards,</b> kill her with a quick shot to the gut.
          <i>DO <u>NOT</u> LET HER FLY.</i> Stop her. Intellectual judgement
          must be safeguarded and preserved—our instinctual talent. A
          coagulation of delirium, she is not a threat, for she is not real.
          Corrective measures are made.
